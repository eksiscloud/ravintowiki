# Tauriini
{{tynkä|Katiska=muokkaamaton siirto linkityksiä varten}}

Tauriini (2-aminoetaanisulfonihappo) on biologisesti tärkeä kemiallinen yhdiste. Puhdas tauriini on valkoista, oikeastaan lähes väritöntä, kiteistä ainetta, joka maistuu lievästi happamalta.

Tauriini on [\[aminohappo]()], mutta ei [\[karboksyylihappo]()]. Tauriini ei osallistu elimistössä alfa-aminokarboksyylihappojen tapaan [\[Proteiinisynteesi|proteiinien synteesiin]()]. Sen sijaan sitä esiintyy elimistössä vapaana aminohappona mm. aivoissa, joissa se on toiseksi yleisin vapaa aminohappo. Tauriinia on lisäksi silmän verkkokalvossa, sydän- ja luustolihaskudoksessa sekä sapessa. Tauriinia erittyy myös äidinmaitoon.

Aikuisessa ihmisessä tauriinia on noin 1000 mg/kg, koirien pitoisuudesta ei ole tietoa.

Tauriinia muodostuu [\[Rikki|rikkiä]()] sisältävistä alfa-aminohapoista, [\[Metioniini|metioniinista]()] ja [\[Kysteiini|kysteiinist]()]ä, joten sitä ei tarvitse välttämättä saada ravinnosta. Tauriinia syntyy sekä maksassa että aivoissa. Tauriinin muodostuminen on melko hidasta ja voimakas lihasrasitus hidastaa sitä entisestään, joten ravinnosta saatavalla tauriinilla on kuitenkin merkitystä. 

Toisin kuin aikuiselle, imeväisikäiselle tauriini on välttämätön ravintoaine, jota on saatava joko äidinmaidosta. Energiajuomien ohella synteettistä tauriinia käytetäänkin äidinmaidonvastikkeiden valmistukseen

Eräille imettäväisille tauriini on elintärkeä kautta koko elämän. Esimerkiksi kissan on saatava riittävästi tauriinia päivittäisestä ravinnostaan. Tauriinia kissan luonnolliseen ruokavalioon tulee sen pyytämistä pikkujyrsijöistä ja linnuista, jotka se syö luineen ja sisäelimineen.

Apinallakin tauriininpuutoksen on havaittu aiheuttavan samantyyppisiä silmän verkkokalvon muutoksia kuin kissalla. Myös ihmislasten verkkokalvon kehitykseen tauriinin voidaan olettaa vaikuttavan, vaikka aivan suoraa näyttöä asiata ei olekaan.

Kypsentäminen tuhoaa suurimman osa tauriinista.

Taurine has many biological roles, such as conjugation of [\[bile acid]()]s, [\[antioxidant|antioxidation]()], [\[osmoregulation]()], [\[membrane stabilizing effect|membrane stabilization]()], and modulation of [\[calcium signaling]()]. It is essential for [\[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]()] function, and development and function of [\[skeletal muscle]()], the [\[retina]()], and the [\[central nervous system]()].

Taurine is an unusual example of a naturally occurring [\[sulfonic acid]()].

===Synthesis===
Synthetic taurine is obtained by the [\[ammonolysis]()] of [\[isethionic acid]()] (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of [\[ethylene oxide]()] with aqueous [\[sodium bisulfite]()]. A direct approach involves the reaction of [\[aziridine]()] with [\[sulfurous acid]()].\<ref\>{{Ullmann | vauthors = Kosswig K |title=Sulfonic Acids, Aliphatic|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_503|isbn=978-3527306732}}\</ref\>

In 1993, about 5,000–6,000&nbsp;tons of taurine were produced for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications.\<ref name=kirk\>{{cite book |editor=Tully PS|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|chapter=Sulfonic Acids|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc|year=2000|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1921120620211212.a01|isbn=978-0471238966}}\</ref\> As of 2010, China alone has more than 40 manufacturers of taurine.

In the laboratory taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.\<ref\>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marvel CS, Bailey CF, Cortese F |year= 1938 |title= Taurine |journal= Org. Synth. |volume= 18 |page= 77 |doi= 10.15227/orgsyn.018.0077}}\</ref\>

===Biosynthesis===
Taurine is naturally derived from [\[cysteine]()]. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the pancreas via the [\[cysteine sulfinic acid]()] pathway. In this pathway, [\[cysteine]()] is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme [\[cysteine dioxygenase]()]. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by [\[sulfinoalanine decarboxylase]()] to form [\[hypotaurine]()]. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by [\[hypotaurine dehydrogenase]()].\<ref\>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sumizu K | title = Oxidation of hypotaurine in rat liver | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 63 | pages = 210–2 | date = September 1962 | pmid = 13979247 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(62)90357-8 }}\</ref\>

Taurine is also produced by the [\[transsulfuration pathway]()], which converts [\[homocysteine]()] into [\[cystathionine]()]. The cystathionine is then converted to [\[hypotaurine]()] by the sequential action of three enzymes: [\[cystathionine gamma-lyase]()], [\[cysteine dioxygenase]()], and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above.\<ref\>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ripps H, Shen W | title = Review: taurine: a "very essential" amino acid | journal = Molecular Vision | volume = 18 | pages = 2673–86 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23170060 | pmc = 3501277 }}\</ref\>

Prematurely born infants are believed to lack the enzymes needed to convert [\[cystathionine]()] to [\[cysteine]()], and may, therefore, become deficient in taurine. Taurine is present in [\[breast milk]()], and has been added to many infant formulas, as a measure of prudence, since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.\<ref\>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heird WC | title = Taurine in neonatal nutrition--revisited | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Taurine functions as an antioxidant, suppressing the toxicity of hypochlorite and hypobromite produced physiologically. Taurine reacts with these halogenating agents to form N-chloro- and N-bromotaurine, which are less toxic than their precursors hypohalides.\<ref\>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcinkiewicz J, Kontny E | title = Taurine and inflammatory diseases | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–20 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 22810731 | pmc = 3894431 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-012-1361-4 }}\</ref\>

Taurine appears essential to the development of [\[passerine]()] birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich [\[spider]()]s to feed their young, particularly just after hatching.
