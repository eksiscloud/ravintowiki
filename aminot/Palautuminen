Recovery period means the alteration from high to low energy demands
compared with exercise. In addition, it means also the normalization of
function and homeostatic equilibrium, restoration of energy reserves,
elimination of accumulated metabolic intermediates and replenishment of
water and ionic composition of the body. The actualisation of these functions
occurs within minutes or in special cases within hours (Viru 1996).

After endurance exercise the adaptive protein
synthesis occurs mainly in the mitocondrial proteins of oxidative or oxidativeglycolytic muscles, whereas after exercises for improved strength, the adaptive
synthesis occurs in regard to the myofibril proteins of glycolytic fibres (Di
Pasquale 1997). The studies with the modification of arterio-venous model and
muscle biopsy showed the increase of leg protein breakdown of 50% (Biolo et
al. 1995b), whereas the whole body protein breakdown increased only slightly
simultaneously following an intense resistance exercise bout. The muscle
protein synthesis was also increased (Biolo et al. 1995b). Post-exercise protein 
breakdown has not been measured in contracting muscle following endurance
exercise in humans, but protein synthesis has been shown to increase 4-hour
post-exercise following long-term exercise (Carraro et al. 1990b). Literature still
lacks the exact timetable for the changes in these parameters.
