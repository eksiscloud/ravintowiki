Gender differences have been
clearly shown in protein metabolism, but there is also evidence that whole body
protein synthesis or breakdown is different between males and females (Tipton
2001). In addition Volpi et al. (1998b) have reported that in the basal postabsorptive state protein oxidation is lower in women than in men, which partly
explains the difference in energy expenditure between males and females. 

Lamont et al. (2001) concluded that women oxidize more lipid than men during
exercise. It is unclear, whether the gender-based differences in whole body fuel
oxidation are related in differences in circulating substrate utilization
(Tarnopolsky et al. 1990). However, some sex-related differences have been
seen in the plasma concentrations of amino aids. Amino acids VAL, LEU, ILE,
GLN, PHE and PRO have shown higher concentrations in men than in women
(Bancel et al. 1994).
