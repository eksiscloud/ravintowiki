Pitkanen H, Mero A, Oja SS, Komi PV, Rusko H, Nummela A, Saransaari P, Takala T. Effects of training on the exercise-induced changes in serum amino acids and hormones. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 01 Aug 2002, 16(3):390-398

The results of the study indicate that the speed and strength training period strongly decreases the fasting concentrations of amino acids in the power-trained athletes in a good anabolic state with the daily protein intake of 1.26 g;pdkg(-1) body weight. At the same time the intensive lactic exercise session induces strong decreases, especially in valine, asparagine, and taurine.
